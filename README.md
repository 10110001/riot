## Riot.js 0.9.0

### The 1kb client side MVP framework

Riot is the fastest, smallest and most powerful client side framework for building large scale web applications. Despite the hilarious size all the building blocks are there: a template engine, router, event library and a strict MVP pattern to keep things organized. Your views are automatically updated when the underlying model changes.

Current applications could be faster, simpler and smaller. They could be maintained with less people, less knowledge, and less worries. The frameworks base their existence on false assumptions:

1. There's a big mass of common problems
2. MVC (or MVP) requires a framework
3. jQuery leads to spaghetti

All of these statements are wrong. *Riot is a manifesto for vanilla JavaScript and jQuery.*

[Introducing Riot.js!](https://moot.it/blog/technology/riotjs-the-1kb-mvp-framework.html).

The official release is coming for Christmas; December 2013.
