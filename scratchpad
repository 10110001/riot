If-mount strategies
====================


When 'if's are updated, the DOM element is moved to a "stub" element.
1. Maybe it's possible to catch when a DOM element has changed location? Even if it's only the grandfather who changed location?

2. If that's not possible, maybe the if element can post an event to all of its grand children that he has moved to the stub

* But have they mounted yet? I think they did.


3. Another strategy might be to test if I have a "stub" as parent somewhere.
Maybe by identifying the stub with an ID.
